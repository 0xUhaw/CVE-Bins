 ### Testing Target
 - Product：iTop
 - Version：2.7.0-beta2
 - Official Website：https://github.com/Combodo/iTop
 - Affect：All Version <= 2.7.0-beta2
 
 ### Abstract
The `restore_exec` function of the `exec.php` page is missing the `LoginWebPage :: DoLogin ()` condition, which will cause the attacker without login to use this function and disclosure of system information.

 ### Concept
1. We download the latest version from the official github and build default environment.

2. View `ajax.backup.php` source code and we guess these miss some condition to check exec.php

3. Now we can use `restore_exec` funtion without login

4. It will expose the system information.
