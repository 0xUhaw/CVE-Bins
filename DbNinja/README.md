 ### Abstract
We discovered that the `Add Host` function of the `Manage Hosts` pages has Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `User Name` field. The attackers can insert malicious js, mining js and others.

 ### Concept
 1. We download the latest version from the official website and build default environment.
