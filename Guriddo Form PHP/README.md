 ### Abstract
We discovered that `/demos/jqform/defaultnodb/default.php` page the `OrderID`, `ShipName`, `ShipAddress`, `ShipCity`, `ShipPostalCode`, `ShipCountry`, `Freight` and `details` parameter has reflected XSS vulnerability

 ### Concept
1. we download the latest version from the official website and view the source code of demos/jqform/defaultnodb/default.php

2. From the default.php source we can see that it is calling defaultnodb.php

3. From defaultnodb.php we can quickly check that the code is not filtered, it can cause problems with XSS.
