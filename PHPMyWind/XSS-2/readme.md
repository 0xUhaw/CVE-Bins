 ### Testing Target
 - Product：PHPMyWind
 - Version：5.5
 - Official Website：http://phpmywind.com/
 - Affect：All Version <= 5.5
 
 ### Abstract
An issue was discovered in PHPMyWind 5.5. The `username` parameter of the `/install/index.php` page has a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

 ### Concept
 1. We download the latest version from the official website and build default environment.

2. In the set steps, we can use BurpSuite to bypass the username check mechanism and insert XSS payload as the admin username.

 2. View `connect.php` source code and find the `method` parameter of line 27 is not filtered, it will cause XSS vulnerabilities.

 3. Now go back to admin login pages, same using BurpSuite change username to login.
